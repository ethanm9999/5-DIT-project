        <p> It is a fun hobby in your life that you could reach the peak of each mountain in just a little bit of hours as the slopes are steep BUT your muscles are exercising too. There are scenic views or panoramas that you could picture for documentation, or discovery of your first trip with above or high elevation. The range of views are possible of 30-50 kms away from your view there.

            <li>Group together as one to make a guide or path from where you have started or finished.</li>
