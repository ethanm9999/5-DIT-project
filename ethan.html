        <p>Switzerland, federated country of central Europe. Switzerland’s administrative capital is Bern, while Lausanne serves as its judicial centre. Switzerland’s small size—its total area is about half that of Scotland—and its modest population give little indication of its international significance.

        A landlocked country of towering mountains, deep Alpine lakes, grassy valleys dotted with neat farms and small villages, and thriving cities that blend the old and the new, Switzerland is the nexus of the diverse physical and cultural geography of western Europe, renowned for both its natural beauty and its way of life. Aspects of both have become bywords for the country, whose very name conjures images of the glacier-carved Alps beloved of writers, artists, photographers, and outdoor sports enthusiasts from around the world.

            Switzerland has long been a model multiethnic, multilingual society, a place in which diverse peoples can live in social harmony and unite in common interest.</p>

        <p>Summer has traditionally been popular among tourists in Switzerland, just like winter. The highest peaks in the Bernese Oberland, Graubünden and Valais are very attractive in summer.</p>

        <p>Switzerland may be landlocked and missing the cool beachfronts of its Mediterranean neighbours, but the mercury can climb just as high at the peak of summer in certain places. If you go to high altitude the temperatures will plummet, but throughout most of the country there is a nice average of 18 to 29 °C (65° – 82° F) from July to August. However, it often rises beyond the 30°C mark during particularly hot summers.</p>
