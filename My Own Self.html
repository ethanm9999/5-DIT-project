        <p>My habit is that I like outdoor activities like walking from my house to the city for 2km. It increases endurance, agility, and andrenaline in your lifestyle. That makes you feel to reduce your time in wasting for doing nothing. Timelapse may be needed because of the measurement and the number of attempts.</p>

        </section>
        
        <section class="text-block">
        <p>My personality is that I have a mother, a father,a grandma, and my relatives and too much friends since I was in the Philippines. Now I was in a moderate mood, since I like to narrate myself of stories, explanations, etc. I wanted to be a Good Samaritan, so I wanted not to break the law of course, just serious act because you want it or making them in a happy mood right now.</p>
